<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="about-section">
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Tangia Zhou. I’m originally from Ottawa, Canada, and I’m currently based in New York City.
    I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto,
    where I built a strong foundation in advanced engineering principles and hands-on problem solving.
     I previously worked at Ciena as an Optical Modem Hardware Engineer, where I contributed to the development and optimization of next-generation optical communication devices.
