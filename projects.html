      <h3>PitLane Switch</h3>

    <p>Oct 2025 – Present</p>
    <p>
      PitLane is a hybrid optical-electrical data center switch architecture designed to combine the flexibility of packet switching with the efficiency of circuit switching. It uses fast optical switches to provide high bandwidth, low latency paths between racks, while a lightweight electrical "pit lane" handles contention, control traffic, and short flows that benefit from packet-level routing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By offloading bulk data transfers to the optical fabric and minimizing optical reconfiguration overhead, PitLane improves throughput and energy efficiency under dynamic workloads, making it well suited for modern data center traffic patterns.

      <h3>Design and Analysis of MRR Optical Filters for Wavelength-Selective Routing in Silicon Photonic Circuits</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-content">
    <p>Oct 2025 – Dec 2025</p>
    <p>
      MRRs enable compact wavelength-selective filtering for WDM optical systems. This study evaluated MRR optical filters for wavelength-selective routing in WDM systems through combined analytical modeling and varFDTD electromagnetic simulation in Ansys Lumerical. Comprehensive parameter space exploration spanning ring radius (5-20 μm), coupling gap (40-200 nm), and waveguide width (250-500 nm) on SOI platforms established performance bounds and revealed fundamental design trade-offs with MRR filter operation.

  <div class="project-content">
    <p>Apr 2024 – Apr 2025</p>
    <p>
      AirPlay Instruments introduces an innovative, software-based solution for music production, leveraging computer vision and gesture recognition to replace traditional MIDI controllers. 
      Designed for musicians, producers and beginners in music, the system allows users to interact with DAWs through natural hand movements, eliminating the need for external hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is built on a modular architecture, combining a Swift-based frontend and a Python-based backend for gesture recognition and MIDI signal generation. 
      Key technologies include MediaPipe for gesture detection, OpenCV for image processing, and Mido for MIDI integration.

      <h3>Melody Improvisation Unit (MIU or µ)</h3>

    <p>
      As the world becomes more reliant on technology, many industries have began an integration of automation into their products. 
      The Melody Improvisation Unit (MIU or μ), serves to improve the music industry’s ability to create new music by improvising a melody with variations in pitches and rhythms based on a series of input chords. MIU is a product that is inspired by a musician’s ability to improvise over a set of chords. 
      It attempts to simulate a musician’s musical intuitions when creating a line of melody. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This project leverages FFT principles to analyze an input sequence of chords by extracting the dominant frequencies from each segment. 
      These frequencies are organized into a matrix, where each vector corresponds to the size of the input chord sequence. 
      A pure tone generator then assigns note durations to the frequencies based on the timing of their respective segments. 
      The resulting pure tones are compiled into a vector and appended to the original chord progression, creating a new melody. 
      To transform the MIU algorithm into a portable and marketable product, a Raspberry Pi 3 is utilized to execute the algorithm and output the generated melody through a speaker.

      <h3>Software Define Radio - Receive Chain</h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="project-content">
    <p>Jan 2022 – Apr 2022</p>
    <p>
      This project involved designing and implementing the receive chain of a Software Defined Radio (SDR), with a focus on optimizing system functionality and performance. This project involved designing and integrating critical components such as an RX limiter, filter, quadrature mixer, and amplifier to ensure seamless system operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schematic capture and circuit simulations were completed in Multisim to validate the design's performance and reliability. The PCB layout process was completed in Altium Designer, delivering a high-quality and efficient board design that adhered to both project specifications and industry standards. To support testing and validation, C-based scripts were developed to interface with and control test measurement equipment via an STM32 Microcontroller, which enabled automated testing and precise data acquisition throughout the development process.
